			<p>When at school I was a long distance runner competing for Surrey and Reigate Priory in the 1500M. When at college the running didn't carry on so much, I was more of a casual
				runner from time to time as it's always been something I have enjoyed.</p>

			<p>Whilst studying, I started my coaching career; first in football and cricket, then swimming.</p>

			<p>I went from college into leisure where I used to coach as well as being a Duty Manager in a busy Centre.</p>

			<p>In 2006 I took up a management role in the Sport Centre at The Hawthorns School, this is when I rediscovered running.</p>

			<p>I was heavily involved in coaching the Athletics team and also took the cross country training weekly plus taking them to fixtures. I completed 4 London marathons - running
				sub 4 hour marathons was a highlight as well as raising awareness for CRY (Cardiac Risk in the Young).</p>

			<p>I am now really enjoying a new career coaching many sports and working with the ladies at RLJ to develop RMJ and working with our men - enabling them to get fit and improve
				their running abilities.</p>

			<p>I look forward to meeting you and helping you achieve your goals.</p>
