			Hi ${firstName},
		</p>
		<p>
			Thanks for registering on our site!
		</p>
		<p>
			Our site is quite new and still undergoing a lot of work, but we'll be updating it with loads of great new stuff to
			help you with achieving your running goals.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, if you have no idea who we are, then perhaps someone has been a bit
			sneaky and used your e-mail address. If this is the case then just contact our site administrator at
			<a href="mailto:administrator@reigatemensjoggers.co.uk">administrator@reigatemensjoggers.co.uk</a>, and you'll
			be removed in a jiffy.
		</p>
		<p>We look forward to seeing you at our next run!</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h4>Chris</h4>
		(And the RMJ team)

			Pssst... We also have a <a href="http://www.reigateladiesjoggers.co.uk">Reigate Ladies Joggers</a> site
			if you know any ladies that are keen runners!
